[cols=""]
Core AHK script.

All included scripts assume the following parameter settings:

[source,autohotkey]

== link:KeyMap.ahk[]

Some basic key(re-)maps. Note that my default keyboard layout is https://colemak.com[Colemak]:

Keybiding excerpts _(some disabled in my current setup)_:

[cols="1,2,2,4",options="header"]
|====
|Active|Key|Action|Description
|{icon-ok}|`XButton1` _(Mouse 4)_|`PageUp`|Faster paging than mouse-wheel. Replaces prev./next _(usually useless)_ binding.
|{icon-ok}|`XButton2` _(Mouse 5)_|`PageDown`|_See above ..._
|{icon-ok}|`Win-Alt-Space`|`MediaKey: Pause`|Easier media key access _(also useful if dedicated keys not available)_.
|{icon-ok}|`Win-Alt-Up`|`MediaKey: Previous Track`|_See above ..._
|{icon-ok}|`Win-Alt-Down`|`MediaKey: Next Track`|_See above ..._
|{icon-ok}|`Win-Alt-0`|`MediaKey: Toggle Mute`|_See above ..._

|{icon-ok}|`Win-x, Win-c`|Close current window|Same as Alt-F4
|{icon-ok}|`Win-x, Win-k`|Kill current window (process)|Easily kill app if not responding
|{icon-ok}|`Alt/Shift-ScrollLock`|Toggle CapsLock|Noone really needs CapsLock nowadays but sometimes it is activated for no apparent reason, so it's good to have a key-binding to deactivate it.
|{icon-ok}|`SC056` _(DE: `<>&#124;`)_|`Control`|If, for some strange twist of faith, I'm forced to use a german QWERTZ keyboard, the otherwise useless `<>&#124;` key will be re-mapped to `Control`.
|{icon-x}|`[ ]`|`( )`|Classic lisp hacker / emacs mapping, but also practical in daily life, since `( )` is more commonly used than `[ ]` even though dedicated keys exist for the latter.
|{icon-ok}|`AltGr-n/e`|`( )`|Home-row access to brackets _(`j/k` on US layout)_.
|{icon-ok}|`AltGr-N/E`|`[ ]`|Home-row access to brackets _(`J/K` on US layout)_.
|{icon-ok}|`AltGr-i/o`|`{ }`|Home-row access to brackets _(`l/;` on US layout)_.
|====

Additional _(currently disabled)_ mappings exist for:

* German umlauts accessible on default german keyboard positions + `AltGr` (e.g. `AltGr-;` &rarr; `รถ`) or like on common international layout _(AltGr)_ position (e.g. `AltGr-p` &rarr; `รถ`).
** The latter is already the case with the international US Colemak layout.
* `CapsLock` &rarr; `Backspace`
** Already default with Colemak layout _(partially not the case in the past)_.
* `CapsLock` &rarr; `Control`
** Old hacker mapping _(e.g. from emacs users)_ but no longer preferred by me. Ctrl already easily accessible but `backspace` requires leaving home-row, so I prefer `backspace` instead.


== link:WindowTracking.ahk[]

A script that tracks current and previous window details, like window id, class, process id, process executable and process name, in global variables, including a hotkey tooltip and clipboard functionality to be used as Windows / AutoHotkey development tool.

By Pressing `Win-F8` _(default key binding)_ the monitoring mode is activated. While active, a tooltip like the following will be shown and updated after each window switch:

image::windowtracking_tootlip_1.png[]

The script includes a blacklist that ignores windows like windows task-bar/-choose, desktop, the AHK tooltip itself and other windows that usually doesn't want to capture. These blacklisted windows are still captured, but in a separate set of variables (single last blacklisted window only).

The details of the last captured blacklisted window can additionally be shown by pressing `Win-Shift-F8` _(default key binding)_:

image::windowtracking_tootlip_2.png[]

The _(default)_ hotkeys `Win-(Alt-)F8` toggle the tooltip _(on/off)_. While monitoring is activated the tooltip will refreshes every time a new window is activated _(focus change)_.

[source,autohetkey]
----
; win-F8 -> toggle tooltip without blacklisted windows
#F8::_toggleShowTrackedWindows() ; clipboard on close, show final tt 5sec
;#F8::_toggleShowTrackedWindows(,0,0) ; no clipboard, close immediate
;#F8::_toggleShowTrackedWindows(,2) ; always clipboard (each change)

; win-shift_F8 -> toggle tooltip with blacklisted windows
#+F8::_toggleShowTrackedWindows(true) ; bl + clipboard on close, show final tt 5sec
;#+F8::_toggleShowTrackedWindows(true,0,0) ; bl + no clipboard, close immediate
;#F8::_toggleShowTrackedWindows(true,2) ; bl + always clipboard (each change)
----

Per default the tooltip content is copied to the clipboard when monitoring is stopped _(toggle off)_. Alternatively it is possible to continuously update the clipboard _(on every window change)_ or to not update the clipboard at all. See the code documentation of `_toggleShowTrackedWindows` and the examples above.

The clipboard text contains the same information as the tooltip but in a slightly simplified/cleaner format using `\t` as column delimiter:

[format=tsv,cols="1,3"]
|===
*ACTIVE WINDOW:*	 &nbsp;
active_id	0x831b5a
active_title	README.adoc - dotfiles - Visual Studio Code
active_class	Chrome_WidgetWin_1
active_pid	343836
active_procname	Code.exe
*PREVIOUS WINDOW:*	&nbsp;
previous_id	0xd61bb4

previous_class	MozillaWindowClass
previous_pid	172388
previous_procname	firefox.exe

== link:XMouseClipboard.ahk[]

This script tries to provide the "copy on selection" and "middle-click paste" features known from X Windows.

=== Middle-click Paste
Allows middle-click (`MButton`) paste in most apps, with "click-through" (`~`) support _(for apps that treat middle-click in a special way, e.g. navigation in 3D/CAD apps)_, and special rules for individual apps like e.g. KITTY/Putty/Firefox _(`MButton` paste configurable)_ or common terminals (`Ctrl-Shift-v`).

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Key|Function
|`MButton`|Paste text into the current app (key binding depending on app, default `Ctrl-v`, terminals usually `Ctrl-Shift-v`, etc.)
|`Shift-MButton`|Same as above but enclose the pasted text into double-quotes `"{Clipboard}"`.
|===

=== Copy on Selection

This one is a bit tricky. For now the script is not able to identify whether a text window / editor is active (with a text selection) or not. It is only able to identify that a _drag_ action was performed with the mouse. Since there are any number of possible drag actions that could be performed, intentionally _(e.g. drag-drop file)_ or unintentionally _(e.g. drag slightly when clicking an action button)_ this approach is not very reliable. In addition, in many cases it is not desired that a selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard _(e.g. select text to override / compare it with the clipboard content)_. That's why this feature is currently disabled (in my scripts), it would need additional work an restrictions _(e.g. terminal windows only)_ to be usable in an acceptable manner. Since most windows terminals already support copy on selection out of the box, there is currently no immediate need for this feature.

== link:ConfineMouse.ahk[]

This scripts confines the mouse to a window's screen area, either of the window currently below the mouse cursor _(default)_ or the active window. The confinement area can optionally be reduced by a fixed margin to exclude the window decoration.

Mouse cursor confinement is sometimes desired when working in a mouse-heavy application or games _(e.g. in windowed mode)_, especially in a multi-screen environment. The scripts helps avoiding exiting the working area and prevent unwanted clicks _(e.g. taskbar, different app, etc.)_.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Key|Function
|`Win-F11`|Toggle window confinement to the window currently below the mouse cursor with a fixed margin, excluding the window decoration.
|`Win-Alt-F11`|Same as above but confined to the full window size, include decoration.
|===

== link:SendToWindow.ahk[]

This script sends a sequence of keys to the current window _(optional)_, switches to a target window, sends another key sequence _(optional)_, and finally switches back to the previous window.

[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Key|Function
|`Win-Alt-e`|Copy _(text only)_ to clipboard, switch to code editor, paste text switch back.
|`Win-Alt-Shift-e`|Copy _(text only)_ to clipboard, switch to code editor, press `End, Return, Home` _(add newline, home to avoid auto-indent)_ and paste text.
|`Win-Alt-;`|Switch to link:https://mpv.io/[mpv]/netflix/youtube an pause playback _(using space)_
|===

The following (configurable) steps are executed in sequence:

* Optionally clear the clipboard (`clipboard_mode > 0`)
* Optionally send a series of keys (`source_keys`) to the active window
* Optionally wait for the clipboard (`clipboard_mode > 0`)
* Optionally stop if clipboard dose contain something other than text (`clipboard_mode == 0`)
* Switch to the `target_window`
* Optionally send a series of keys (`target_keys`) to the target window
* Switch back to the previously active window

=== Hotkey Examples

Note that the default parameters are set to copy text only (`clipboard_mode = 1`) using `Ctrl-c` (`source_keys = "^c"`) and `Ctrl-v` (`target_keys = "^v"`).

[source,autohetkey]
----
;; copy text only to Notepad++ (no fancy stuff)
_sendToWindow("ahk_class i)^Notepad\+\+$")

;; copy text only to emacs using Ctrl-y to paste
_sendToWindow("ahk_class i)^Emacs$",, "^y")

;; switch to mpv/netflix/youtube an pause playback (using space)
_sendToWindow("^(.* mpv|Netflix .*|.* YouTube .*)$", "", "{Space}", 0)

;; copy to KITTY SSH session (host 10.0.23.12) using Shift-Insert, finally press Return
_sendToWindow("i)10.0.23.12.*ssh.*Kitty",, "+{Insert}{Return}")

;; copy to WordPad into a new line and add newline after pasting, copy non-text too (e.g. images)
_sendToWindow("ahk_class WordPadClass",, "{End}{Return}^v{Return}", 2)
----
